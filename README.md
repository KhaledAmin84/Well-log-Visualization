# Well-log-Visualization
this practice is illustrate the visualize well log data using matplotlib Library,
Python is a programming language widly used in oil and gas industry, it is effective tool in data analysis and Machine learning.
there are many libraries very important in O & G industry like pandas, numpy to explore and analyse the data , and matplotlib which is very helpful tool in plotting diffrent types of Geoscience data like well log data with easy and simple way,
in this tuturial we run code about how can use these libraries to explore well log data (LAS file) and plot these logs like the traditional view, and how to setup tracks and plot two curves on top of each other (LLS & LLD),
also we will setup tracks to plot Formation tops and othe for runing lithology
